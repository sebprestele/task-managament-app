Pre-Assignment for Integrify Academy

Task Management App that lets the user add new tasks, delete them all or individually.

A few of the concepts I used and learned while building.

DOM manipulation

Used Event Delegation to toggle class on completed tasks

Used localStorage and JSON to store the tasks in the browser and retrieve them on page refresh.
